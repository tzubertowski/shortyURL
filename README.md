Shorty is a simple PHP project that creates an alias of a url you want to shorten. When alias is accessed it checks for the alias & url in the DB then proceed to redirect you to the url you wished to see.
db.inc has all the configuration needed for DB to connect, customize your data there. db.sql has the DB configuration, just run it on your mysql server.

ps. Don't forget to edit the domain name in redirect.php, otherwise its just gonna be generic domain printed to your user.

Have fun & don't forget to star this project if you've found it helpfull.
